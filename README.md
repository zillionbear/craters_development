# craters development
 My personal repo for Xcode things and stuffs.

Getting my projects onto Xcode

1. Clone my repo whichever way you would like
2. Find the Xcode Project file for the target project
3. Open the project

Deployment onto hardware

//You will need a developer Apple ID. You will also need Xcode 10 or newer. You will obviously need hardware, as in an iDevice.

1. Log into your developer Apple ID in Xcode
2. Open my project which should by now be imported
3. Allow Xcode to automatically sign the project with your Apple ID

//If Xcode didn't automatically sign the project, you may use Apple's support page
